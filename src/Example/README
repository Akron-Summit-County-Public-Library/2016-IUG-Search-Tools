# Examples

1. Rename `config.json.dist` to `config.json`
2. Change the parameters after obtaining API Keys (see developer.iii.com to get started)
3. Look at the different PHP files to see different information sources

Then use what you know to:

* Experiment (in the programming language of choice)
* Extend to suit your needs
* Learn by example in developing a system integration tool on your own!
